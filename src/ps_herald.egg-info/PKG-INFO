Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The Herald  package provides three tools usable to monitor the behaviour of distributed applications
        
        Herald's functionality is based on the **Basic** class, defined in the ps.basic package.
        
        The **Basic** class enhances/uses the standard python logging package - especially  the ability to log messages 
        to a stream-socket.
        
        This package adds mechanisms to:
        
                        - put these messages into a central database (bridge)
                        - route/bridge  these messages to additional destinations (bridge)
                        - display in a web-server (herald)
                        - take actions on special messages (neelix)
                        - take actions on lost system heartbeat (neelix)
